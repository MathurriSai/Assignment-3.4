1. Explain the importance of Namenode in Hadoop cluster

The major importance of Name node in Hadoop cluster are:
* The Namenode forms the centre part of HDFS file system . It keeps in track of all the files in the file system and will not track any
data regarding the files.
*And teh client will conatct the name node regarding where to locate the file as well where to add or copy or remove a file.when the data lives 
the name node will successfuly list the relevant data.
* In case , of HDFS cluster the name node is a point of failure since HDFS is not a high availability system.the file system will tend to go
offline when the data node goes down.in parallel the secondary name node will be hosted in a seperate machine.
* It is just an check point which merge the edit file into the fsimage.
* HDFS will cannot be accessed when the namenode is not available.

And there are certain essentials to look after the name node:
- There is a need a need for good server with a huge AM sace.when the file system is large or small block size then ECC RAM is used.
- Datanode,job tracker and task tracker cannot be hosted at a time.
- It is neccesary to monitor the space of disc and to ad more space wehn the disk space gets low.
- Seperate disc from image must be used to configure the name node to store one set of transaction logs.
- Another transaction log will be stored in network mounted disc.

2. Practice the beginners commands for HDFS from the below link

     a) directory craetion
     b) directory Contents  
     c) put command -copied the file Sample.txt to HDFS
     d) get command - copied the file from HDFS to local system
     e) utility checking  - DFS Filesystem to Check Utility
     f) Directory Space - To Check the Directory Space in HDFS
     g) ls command - ‘list’ command which displays the available files inside a particular path.
     h) hadoop balancer - ‘balancer’ in it will check for work load on nodes in cluster and balance it.
     i) HELP - ‘help’ command is used for query.
     j) Removing file from HDFS - The command ‘rm’ will delete the file stored inside the HDFS.
